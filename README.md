## Data Science Project examples

# [Project 1: Data Science example: Customer engagement analysis (Logistic Regression)](https://github.com/vinayamsnl/Customer-Analysis-Project)

* In this example I analysed a fin-tech customers and transactions data to analyse their customers usage patterns 
* Prepared analysis data using customers data, transaction data, notification data and device data to get insight into customers usage patterns and engagement levels
* Performed exploratory analysis to identify the important features effecting the customer engagment using Weight of Evidence (WOE) and Information Value(IV)
* Performed variable binning for categorical variables with large number of categories
* Built a logistic regressionmodel to predict the chances of customer churn using their customers data along with transactions, notifications data containing notifications to customers and devices data 


# [Project 2: Data Science example: Sales Analysis - EDA and Model (Regression and XGBoost)](https://github.com/vinayamsnl/Vinay_Portfolio/tree/master)

* In this example I analysed beer sales data and quantitatively assessed the impact of features like average day temperature, hours of day light and holiday indicator
* Analyzed the correlation between beer sales, hours of daylight, average temprature. 
* Identified the problem of multicollinearity
* Built a regression model with given features impacting beer sales and used this model to predicte next months sales 
* Built two regression model using statsmodel library, one with highly multicollinear variables and second after excluding one of multicollinear variable
* Created new features (time series based) that could possibly impact the sales with
* Also built a Xgboost regression model and produced a list of top feature impacting bear sales
