## [Project 1: Identify External Features Affecting Product Sales (Correlation, Regression and XGBoost)](https://github.com/vinayamsnl/Data-Science-Projects)

* In this example I analysed beer sales data and quantitatively assessed the impact of features like average day temperature, hours of day light and holiday indicator
* Analyzed correlation between beer sales, hours of daylight, average temprature. Also detected the problem of multicollinearity
* Built a regression model with given features impacting beer sales and used this model to predicte next months sales 
* Explored how multicollinearity effect model by building two regression models (statsmodel library), one with highly collinear variables and another after excluding one of the collinear variables
* Created new features (time based) that could possibly effect the sales
* Built a Xgboost regression model with new features and produced a list of top feature impacting bear sales

## [Project 2: Cancer Tumour Classification (EDA and SVM Model)](https://github.com/vinayamsnl/Data-Science-Projects)

* In this use case I analysed cancer tumours data comprises of 30 features derived from cancer cell images and built a classification model to classify malignant and benign cancer tumour types 
* Performed EDA and visualised target and predictor variables. Prepared data for model training and validating.
* Built classification model using SVM (Support Vector Machine-95% plus accuracy).
* Also impemented model parameter tunning to detect best model parameters to improve model's accuracy
* Produced model performance statistics such as Recall, Precision, F1-score and Accuracy

## [Project 3: Customer churn prediction for finance subscription product](https://github.com/vinayamsnl/Data-Science-Projects)
* The objective of this case study is to build a model to predict the customers which are likely to churn by analysing customers financial habits 
* Analysed product related data consists of customers finances details and how customers are handeling their finances using the product
* Visualised explanatory variables and relationship between explanatory and target churn variable
*


## [Project 4: Customer engagement analysis (Logistic Regression)](https://github.com/vinayamsnl/Customer-Analysis-Project)

* In this case study I analysed a fin-tech company's customers and transactions data to get insight into customer enegagment with their product
* Prepared data related to customers (demographics and other details) and transactions to get insight into customers usage patterns and types of engagements
* Deep dived into data by perforing exploratory data analysis to identify the important features effecting the customer engagement using Weight of Evidence (WOE) and Information Value(IV)
* Performed variable binning for categorical variables with large number of categories
* Built a logistic regressionmodel to predict the chances of customer churn using their customers data along with transactions, notifications data containing notifications to customers and devices data
